# SNU-BRL

Welcome to the SNU Biorobotics Laboratory. Since the fall of 2008, SNU biorobotics lab has been developing soft biologically inspired mechanisms and robots especially with the goal of developing innovative ways of creating motion without rigid joints and rigid links for life-like robots. 

Biology has lots of inspiration for creating the new mechanisms. New component technologies, such as soft materials, novel fabrications methods, novel actuator technology and novel fabrication technology, are important for realizing the biologically inspired novel mechanisms. We apply these  technologies to build soft wearable robots for people with disability, novel soft robots, bionic hand, and bio-inspired robots with mobility. Most of all, the goal of the SNU Biorobotics Lab is to foster and educate innovative  and empathetic researchers that will be the agents of change for the future.
